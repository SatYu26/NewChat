This Flutter App encounters one of the major issue you all might also be facing in WhatsApp, which is that we have to save the contact of the person if we want to send the message to him/her.<br>
But there are many encounters where we might never need the contact of that person in future and still we needed to save their contact, keeping this problem in mind i created this app which allows you to send the WhatsApp message to any number without having you save it in our device.<br>

You can choose any country code and create a WhatsApp message without saving the contact in your device.<br>

My motivation behind making this app was <a href="https://github.com/iampawan">Pawan Kumar</a> sir, i saw his one of the motivational <a href="https://youtu.be/Py5S8Lbp63Y">video</a> where he talked about his app <a href="http://bit.ly/click2analyze">Click2Chat</a> and it inspired me also to make something for my own personal use.
I have tried to keep the UI very simple and neat, so that anyone can use it easily. I will try to improve this app more and more and all contributions are welcome.
